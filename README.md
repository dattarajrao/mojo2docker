## H2O MOJO 2 Docker

This is an Open Source project that tries to bridge the gap between Data Scientists and Software Developers. 
H2O is an engine for building Machine Learning models which are exported as MOJO zip files. 
This project shows a way to convert those ZIP files into docker images which can be hosted as microservices on Kubernetes.
